# Slingshot 

Slingshot, for **Android** is a boilerplate project designed to accelerate the development of Android applications. With an emphasis on scalability and maintainability, this project provides a ready-made structure based on the **MVVM** architecture pattern and comes pre-configured with essential tools.

This repository is perfect for developers who want to quickly set up an Android app while following best practices and architecture patterns, enabling you to focus on writing the features and logic that matter.

## Libraries Used

- **MVVM Architecture**: Easily scale and manage your app's complexity.
- **Retrofit**: Simple, type-safe HTTP client for making network requests.
- **Room Database**: Local storage implementation that allows seamless data persistence.
- **Glide**: Efficient image loading and caching.

## Components Breakdown
1. **ViewModel + Base ViewModel**
   The ViewModel handles UI-related data and persists it during configuration changes. The BaseViewModel class includes common functionality like error handling and loading state management, which can be shared across all ViewModels. The child ViewModel extends BaseViewModel to focus on business logic.

2. **Retrofit + Network Layer**
   Retrofit handles all HTTP requests, and the network layer is abstracted with the help of a repository. This makes it easy to switch data sources or handle responses consistently across the app. The RetrofitClient provides the instance of Retrofit and ensures a single point of configuration for API calls.

3. **Room Database**
   Room is used for local persistence. The repository layer abstracts all interactions with Room, making it simple to fetch, insert, or update data from the local database. It provides a clear separation of concerns, where data access is decoupled from business logic.

4. **Glide for Image Loading**
   Glide is integrated for smooth and efficient image loading. We provide a utility method for consistent image handling across the app, including caching and placeholder management.

5. **Factory Pattern for ViewModels**
   A custom ViewModelFactory is provided to inject dependencies into the ViewModel. This allows for a clean and testable architecture, especially when the ViewModel requires dependencies like repositories or other services.
